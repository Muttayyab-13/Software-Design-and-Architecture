MVC Pattern Example: Shopping Cart
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern using a Shopping Cart use case. The MVC pattern separates the application logic into three interconnected components, improving maintainability and scalability.

Project Overview
This application allows users to:

Add items to a shopping cart.
View the contents of the cart.
The project is divided into:

Model: Manages the application's data and business logic.
View: Displays data to the user.
Controller: Handles user input and updates the Model and View.
