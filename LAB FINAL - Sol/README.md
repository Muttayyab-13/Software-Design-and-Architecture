# USE CASE: User Monitors and Controls Iot Devices for Energy Control
## ARCHITECTURE : MVC(Model View Controller)

 ## Overview

This project implements an IoT Device Monitoring and Control System using the MVC Architecture. The system enables users to monitor and control IoT devices via a mobile app, with data processing and analytics handled by cloud infrastructure.

 ## Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

	•	Model: Represents the data and business logic for users, IoT devices, and cloud infrastructure.
 
	•	View: A mobile app serves as the user interface, displaying device statuses, energy usage, and notifications.
 
	•	Controller: Acts as the intermediary, processing user commands, interacting with the cloud, and updating the app with relevant data.
 

Features

	•	User authentication and management.
 
	•	Monitoring and controlling IoT device statuses.
 
	•	Notifications and energy usage analytics.
 
	•	Cloud-based data storage and processing.
